Custom Package Installer - Install file example
This documentation explains how to format your "install.cpi" file correctly

Line 1 : Version (ex.: 2.0.1)
Line 2 : File that gets executed (ex.: cpi.cmd)
Line 3+: There are multiple options for what can you put after line 2:

1. Create a new directory under "%UserProfile%\.cpi\pkg\pkg-name"
To indicate that you want to create a new directory, use "cpi-pkgmd" (Ex.: cpi-pkgmd /example/directory)

2. Create a new directory anywhere on the computer
To indicate that you want to create a new directory, use "cpi-md" (Ex.: cpi-md /example/directory)

3. Download another file from the same Github repository under "%UserProfile%\.cpi\pkg\pkg-name"
To download a file from the same Github repository, use "cpi-pkgdl" the file name followed by the location 
where you want to download the file (the directory MUST already exist) (Ex.: img.png /images)

4. Download another file from the internet
To download a file from the internet, write the file name followed by the location 
where you want to download the file (the directory MUST already exist) (Ex.: https://website.com/img.png C:/users/public)

5. Make a comment
To insert a comment, write your comment between two exclamation marks (MUST be on it's own line) (Ex.: !This is a comment!)
